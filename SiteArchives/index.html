		<div>SiteArchive
</div>
		<div>Internet is forgetful. This site isn’t. 
This site presents you a few archives of websites, collected through time. The collection is unimportant by the content, but important in its form and its meaning. 
When I established my blog, it was already way after the time that blogs prosper, and people are used to reading from WeChat Public Accounts, and other new-era web apps. My idea of blogging was simple: to write things that are easily searchable, so that one day when someone needs that piece of information, he/she can reach it through any search engine.
This subpage of my blog serves as a continuation of that ideology. It collects a few webpages that I ever created, or liked, the origin of which long ceased to exist.
May humanity never forget.
